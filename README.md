# NPS_project
Extracting and asking questions about the data from Make School students' ratings for each course.

## Summary

# Q1: Although there is a trend upwards in the graph, the last week is an outlier with the small amount of people who filled out a response. Overall the ratings stayed consistent throughout the courses.

# Q2: Out of all the cities, San Francisco is the one on top. The top track picked by students from SF is Apps, same trend for the rest of Students at Make School. Also the only students who took the VR Track were from San Francisco.

# Q3: In summary most people think the apps class pacing was just right. Interestingly not a single person said the apps class was way too slow.

# Q4: Apps turns out to have the most promoters by a long shot with Games, Explorer being the least.

# Q5: The NPS score tuned out to be around 44.5
